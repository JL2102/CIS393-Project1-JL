This is an HTML file for a restaurant website. The website has a navigation menu, a hero section, a reservation form, a menu section, and an online ordering section.

The navigation menu contains links to Home, Menu, Reservations, Order Online, and Contact Us pages.

The hero section has a welcome message and a brief introduction to the restaurant's mission.

The reservation form can be accessed by clicking on a "Make a Reservation" button. The form includes fields for name, email, phone number, reservation date/time, and number of guests.

The menu section has four categories: Appetizers, Entrees, Desserts, and Drinks. Each category has an image, a title, and a description.

The online ordering section has a form that allows customers to place an order. The form includes fields for name, email, phone number, and address.

The HTML file also links to three JavaScript files: ModalButton.js, form-validation.js, and OnlineOrderValidation.js. ModalButton.js is used to show and hide the reservation form. form-validation.js is used to validate the reservation and online ordering forms. OnlineOrderValidation.js is used to validate the online ordering form.

Additionally, the HTML file links to a style.css file that contains the CSS styles for the entire website.
